## The goal

Mainly the following two things:

1. Make it easy to create and publish project scaffolds with reusable templates, styles, themes, data etc.
2. To uncouple these "non-moving-parts", which can easily be described using a declarative configuration, from any particular build system or generator. 

_(To see the opposite of what this project hopes to achieve, take a look at a generator from [Google's Yeoman][yeoman]. Yeoman is a node.js application that generates projects from "scaffolding", which includes templates, project metadata, and so on. But it does so in a way that completely couples these things with application logic, making it difficult or tedious to make the components reusable by anything but yeoman)_.

**Example**

The following scaffold "expands" into a configuration object that can be passed to [gulp][], [grunt][], [assemble][], [metalsmith][], or even [yeoman][] for scaffolding out various parts of a blog or site (like adding a new post, UI component, etc):

```js
var Scaffold = require('{%= name %}');
var scaffold = new Scaffold({
  posts: {
    src: 'templates/post.md',
    dest: 'blog/' 
  },
  components: {
    cwd: 'content',
    src: ['templates/*.hbs'],
    dest: 'blog/'
  }  
});
```

**Example result**

The above scaffold might expand into something like the following:

```js
{
  options: {},
  blog: {
    options: {cwd: 'blog'},
    files: [
      {
        src: ['content/post.md', 'content/about.md'],
        dest: 'src/posts/'
      },
      {
        src: ['data/ipsum.json'],
        dest: 'src/data/'
      }
    ]
  },
  components: {
    options: {cwd: 'ui'},
    files: [
      {
        options: {cwd: 'templates/layouts'},
        src: ['default.hbs', '3-column.hbs'],
        dest: 'src/templates/layouts'
      },
      {
        options: {cwd: 'templates/components'},
        src: ['button.hbs', 'modal.hbs', 'navbar.hbs'],
        dest: 'src/templates/partials'
      },
      {
        src: ['scripts/button.js'],
        dest: 'src/assets/js/'
      },
      {
        src: ['data/ipsum.json'],
        dest: 'src/assets/data/'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Since we're just creating an object (with zero application logic), anything can obviously be extended, overridden, etc. 

## Install

{%= include("install-npm", {save: true}) %}

## Usage

Create an instance of scaffold:

```js
var Scaffold = require('{%= name %}');
var foo = new Scaffold({
  // config/options here  
});
```

Scaffold uses [expand-target][] and [expand-files][] as dependencies. Visit those projects for the full range of available features and options:

## Examples

The following are just a few random examples of what a scaffold could be, but there are many more use cases. 

**Blog posts**

Create a scaffold for adding blog posts to a project:

```js
var blog = new Scaffold({
  post: {
    cwd: 'content',
    src: 'content/post.md', 
    dest: 'src/posts/'
  }
});
```

**UI components**

Create a scaffold for adding UI components to a project:

```js
var components = new Scaffold({
  foo: {
    options: {cwd: 'scaffolds'},
    files: [
      {src: 'templates/component.hbs', dest: 'src/templates/'},
      {src: 'scripts/component.js', dest: 'src/scripts/'},
      {src: 'styles/component.css', dest: 'src/styles/'},
    ]
  }
});
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## What is a scaffold?

A scaffold consists of one or more templates or source files and serves as a "temporary support structure" that may be used to initialize a new project, or to provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project.

**What does this project do?**

Given the above definition, this project provides an API for creating configuration objects with various details about a scaffold, such as source file paths or glob patterns, destination paths, default settings, and so on.

The resulting object could be described as a "scaffold configuration" or "scaffold manifest".

### Comparison table

The following table describes the difference between boilerplates, scaffolds and templates.

| **type** | **description** |
| --- | --- |
| [template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) | Resuable file, code or content which contains "placeholder" values that will eventually be replaced with real values by a rendering (template) engine |
| [scaffold](#{%= name %}) | Consists of one or more templates or source files and serves as a "temporary support structure" that may be used to initialize a new project, or to provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project. |
| [boilerplate](https://github.com/boilerplates) | Boilerplates consist of all of the necessary files required to initialize a complete project. |
