# Publishing scaffolds

> You've authored your first scaffold, now it's time to share your amazing work with the rest of the world!

## Tell the world!

- Add the `scaffold` keyword to `package.json`, `bower.json`, or whatever project manifest is relevant for your project.
- Create a pull request to [let us know about your scaffold](https://github.com/scaffolds/scaffolds/issues/new?title=scaffold-%5Bname%20here%5D&body=I%20created%20a%20new%20scaffold%3A%0A%0A*%20homepage%3A%20%5Bproject%20url%5D%20%0A*%20description%3A%20%5Bscaffold%20description%5D)!
- Tweet about your scaffold!

## Good practice

- In addition to the `scaffold` keyword, a handful of semantically relevant `keywords` in package.json will make your project more likely to show up in NPM searches.
